At a low level, squirrel iterstream is defined through a class called :py:class:`Composable`. All chaining methods are defined within this class, and can be applied at its high level twin class called :py:class:`IterableSource`.

This section we show the APIs defined in :py:class:`Composable` and their detailed definitions.
