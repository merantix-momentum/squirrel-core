Huggingface, Hub, Torchvision
=============================
Squirrel lets you easily load data from common databases such as 
`Huggingface <https://huggingface.co/>`_, 
`Activeloop Hub <https://www.activeloop.ai/>`_ and
`Torchvision <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html>`_. 
We provide lightweight wrappers around these libraries with custom drivers as documented in our `squirrel-datasets-core <https://squirrel-datasets-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package.
